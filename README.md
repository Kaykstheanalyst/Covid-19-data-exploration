# Covid-19-dataset

## Overview
In this project, Covid-19 dataset was used for detailed exploration and the data reveal quite a lot of insightful information.
The exploration reveals countries and conntinent with high number of infected persons alongside the number of death caused 
by the pandemic and the number of vaccinnated persons.

## Data Source
The datasets used for the analysis can be downloaded here [CovidDeaths.xlsx](https://github.com/Kaykstheanalyst/Covid-19-dataset/files/13380577/CovidDeaths.xlsx)

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel- Data cleaning 
- SSMS Data Exploration, Data Analysis

## Skills demonstrated
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis
- Data Exploration

## Insight 
- The data exploration reveals that the United States has the highest infected peprsons in the world witha number of 576232,
  with a very wide margin compared to the other like Brazil which comes second. 
- Europe as a continent has the highest number of deaths as a result of the pandemic compared to other continent in the
  world followed by North America
- The total number of deaths experienced during the pandemic was estimated at 3,180,206
